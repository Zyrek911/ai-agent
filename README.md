# AI-Agent
This is a simple AI agent built for the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) course!

## WARNING:
This agent was built for a project with personal usage in mind, it does not have the security and safety standards that a production AI agent would have, it is for learning purposes only. So if you intend to use this then be careful.

## USAGE:
Using this will require your own gemini api key. Follow these steps:-
1. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project
2. File should contain this line: GEMINI_API_KEY = "Your API key here"
3. Save and Exit, it should work now. CLI usage is- uv run main.py \<Your prompt here\>
